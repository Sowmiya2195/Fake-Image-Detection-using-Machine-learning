# Fake-Image-Detection-using-Machine-learning
Fake Image Detection uses machine learning to identify whether an image is real or manipulated. By analyzing features like noise patterns, edges, and inconsistencies, a trained model (often a CNN) can classify images as real or fake, helping detect deepfakes and digitally altered contentÂ efficiently.
